Webots 7.x.x

  Simulation :

    Added a new example, called symmetry
    Modified gait section in the 'config.ini' file
    Modified gait manager in order to be closer from the one from the real robot
    Changed initial position of all servos in order to be like for the real robot, now the initial position is sit down
    Added a small damping to each servos in the proto
    Changed most of the BoundingBoxes
    Added the possibility to enable the self collision check
    Added description in the example 'sample' and 'symmetry'

  Cross-Compilation:
    
    Changed the reading of the servos states, everything is now done in robot::step in one packet (by using BulkRead function of the CM730), gain of time
    Changed the writing of the servos settings, everything is now done in robot::step in one packet (by using SyncWrite function of the CM730), gain of time
    Added the possibility to set the time step in the 'config.ini' file
    Modified gait manager in order to be independant from the time step
    Suppressed the readTable function to read the sensors value, and read of the sensors value thanks to the BulkRead
    Added the possibility to set height and with of the camera in the 'config.ini' file
    

Webots 7.0.1

Released on October 26th, 2012 (revision 11978)

  Simulation :

    Added Three BackLeds in the proto
    Added minPosition & maxPosition for each servos in the proto
    Revised maxForce for each servos in the proto
    Added the inertiaMatrix to all physics nodes in the proto
    Revised some centerOfMass in the proto
    Fixed bug with the mottion manager in simulation, it is now possible to play motions that are stored in more than one page

  Cross-Compilation:

    Revised accelerometer and gyro reading
    Fixed namespace issue in the module camera
    Fixed inversion of color for the rgb led
    Added a speacker module
    Added setMotorForce & getPosition in the servos module
    Fixed inversion of motion file in the motion manager
    Added setVelocity, setForce, setAcceleration, setControlP & getMotorForceFeedback in servos module
    Fixed wrong initialization of the linuxMotionTimer
    Changed enabling and disabling of the joint in the gait and motion manager
    Modified getWidth() & getHeight() in the module camera in order to change dynamically the value
    Added a minimalist self collision avoidance in setPosition of the servos module
    Modified timming management in robot step
    Changed the reading of the sensors value, everything is read in one packet (by using ReadTable function of the CM730) in the robot::step, gain of time.
