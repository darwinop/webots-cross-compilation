Webots 7.0.4

  Simulation :

    Added Vision Manager in order to use the main image processing tools of the Framework in simulation
    Added example Visual Tracking
    Updated example Sample to use Manager Vision
    Corrected wrong link between Head and Eye LED
    Added the two backLED representations of Head and Eye LED (these backLED are not controllable)
    Replaced motion 57 by motion 24 in the example 'sample' at the beginning
    Improved Gait manager to wait the end of the step before to stop walking
    Modified example Sample to be compatible with cross-compilation


  Cross-Compilation:
    
    Vision Manager is also available on the real robot
    Improved start of the controller, servo movements smoother at startup
    Added LED indications (red : robot is initializing / green : robot is ready, controller will start)


Webots 7.0.3

Released on December 6th, 2012 (revision 12573) 

  Simulation :

    Corrected center of mass of LegLowerL and LegLowerR (thanks to Chase)
    Added field staticFriction and adapted field dampingConstant for each servos
    Added a warning if the MotionManager is used without having enabled all the servos position and auto enable them

  Cross-Compilation:
    
    Fixed inversion of sign of the value returned by Servo::getMotorForceFeedback
    Fixed the direction of the force applied by Servo::setForce which was wrong for some servos


Webots 7.0.2

Released on November 16th, 2012 (revision 12294) 

  Simulation :

    Added a new example, called symmetry
    Modified gait section in the 'config.ini' file
    Modified gait manager in order to be closer from the one from the real robot
    Changed initial position of all servos in order to be like for the real robot, now the initial position is sit down
    Added a small damping to each servos in the proto
    Changed most of the BoundingBoxes
    Added the possibility to enable the self collision check
    Added description in the example 'sample' and 'symmetry'
    Added balance to the gait manager
    Added acceleration and maxVelocity field for each servo
    Corrected Accelerometer orientation (inversion of axes X and Z)

  Cross-Compilation:
    
    Changed the reading of the servos states, everything is now done in robot::step in one packet (by using BulkRead function of the CM730), gain of time
    Changed the writing of the servos settings, everything is now done in robot::step in one packet (by using SyncWrite function of the CM730), gain of time
    Added the possibility to set the time step in the 'config.ini' file
    Modified gait manager in order to be independant from the time step
    Suppressed the readTable function to read the sensors value, and read of the sensors value thanks to the BulkRead
    Added the possibility to set height and with of the camera in the 'config.ini' file
    

Webots 7.0.1

Released on October 26th, 2012 (revision 11978)

  Simulation :

    Added Three BackLeds in the proto
    Added minPosition & maxPosition for each servos in the proto
    Revised maxForce for each servos in the proto
    Added the inertiaMatrix to all physics nodes in the proto
    Revised some centerOfMass in the proto
    Fixed bug with the mottion manager in simulation, it is now possible to play motions that are stored in more than one page

  Cross-Compilation:

    Revised accelerometer and gyro reading
    Fixed namespace issue in the module camera
    Fixed inversion of color for the rgb led
    Added a speacker module
    Added setMotorForce & getPosition in the servos module
    Fixed inversion of motion file in the motion manager
    Added setVelocity, setForce, setAcceleration, setControlP & getMotorForceFeedback in servos module
    Fixed wrong initialization of the linuxMotionTimer
    Changed enabling and disabling of the joint in the gait and motion manager
    Modified getWidth() & getHeight() in the module camera in order to change dynamically the value
    Added a minimalist self collision avoidance in setPosition of the servos module
    Modified timming management in robot step
    Changed the reading of the sensors value, everything is read in one packet (by using ReadTable function of the CM730) in the robot::step, gain of time.
