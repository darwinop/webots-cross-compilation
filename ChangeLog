  Remote-control:


Webots 7.1.2

Released on March 11th, 2013 (revision 13812) 

  Added the possibility to use MotionManager step-by-step (both for simulation and cross-compilation)

  Cross-Compilation:
    Minors debug when cross-compiling from the robot window on Windows (checkbox 'make default controller' now toogle correctly, message windows are not hidden behind the robot window anymore)

  Remote-control:
    Fixed problem of crash of the remote-server when sending command to servos who doesn't exist
    Fixed problem of crash of the robot window when aborting start of remote-control   
    Fixed problem of led switching off when stopping the controller
    

Webots 7.1.1

Released on March 7th, 2013 (revision 13751) 

  Added remote-control
  Added custom robot-window which allows to install Webots API on the robot, start remote-control and cross-compile easily

  Simulation :

    Corrected wrong link between the LEDS: BackLedRed, BackLedGreen and BackLedBlue
    Set default basicTimeStep to 16ms for each example
    Increase camera refresh time to 32ms in example 'Soccer' and 'Visual_tracking'
    Manager static library split into two dynamics libraries, now located in /libraries/darwin and /libraries/managers instead of /lib

  Cross-Compilation:
    
    Added text-to-speech functions in Speaker module

Webots 7.1.0

Released on January 18th, 2013 (revision 13099) 

  Simulation :

    Added Vision Manager in order to use the main image processing tools of the Framework in simulation
    Added example Visual Tracking
    Updated example Sample to use Manager Vision
    Corrected wrong link between Head and Eye LED
    Added the two backLED representations of Head and Eye LED (these backLED are not controllable)
    Replaced motion 57 by motion 24 in the example 'sample' at the beginning
    Improved Gait manager to wait the end of the step before to stop walking
    Modified example Sample to be compatible with cross-compilation
    Renamed example 'Sample' in example 'Soccer'.
    Added showRobotWindow field
    Added example Walk


  Cross-Compilation:
    
    Vision Manager is also available on the real robot
    Improved start of the controller, servo movements smoother at startup
    Added LED indications (red : robot is initializing / green : robot is ready, controller will start)
    Added keyboard functions (a small window appears now on the real robot to catch keyboard inputs when enabling it)


Webots 7.0.3

Released on December 6th, 2012 (revision 12573) 

  Simulation :

    Corrected center of mass of LegLowerL and LegLowerR (thanks to Chase)
    Added field staticFriction and adapted field dampingConstant for each servos
    Added a warning if the MotionManager is used without having enabled all the servos position and auto enable them

  Cross-Compilation:
    
    Fixed inversion of sign of the value returned by Servo::getMotorForceFeedback
    Fixed the direction of the force applied by Servo::setForce which was wrong for some servos


Webots 7.0.2

Released on November 16th, 2012 (revision 12294) 

  Simulation :

    Added a new example, called symmetry
    Modified gait section in the 'config.ini' file
    Modified gait manager in order to be closer from the one from the real robot
    Changed initial position of all servos in order to be like for the real robot, now the initial position is sit down
    Added a small damping to each servos in the proto
    Changed most of the BoundingBoxes
    Added the possibility to enable the self collision check
    Added description in the example 'sample' and 'symmetry'
    Added balance to the gait manager
    Added acceleration and maxVelocity field for each servo
    Corrected Accelerometer orientation (inversion of axes X and Z)

  Cross-Compilation:
    
    Changed the reading of the servos states, everything is now done in robot::step in one packet (by using BulkRead function of the CM730), gain of time
    Changed the writing of the servos settings, everything is now done in robot::step in one packet (by using SyncWrite function of the CM730), gain of time
    Added the possibility to set the time step in the 'config.ini' file
    Modified gait manager in order to be independant from the time step
    Suppressed the readTable function to read the sensors value, and read of the sensors value thanks to the BulkRead
    Added the possibility to set height and with of the camera in the 'config.ini' file
    

Webots 7.0.1

Released on October 26th, 2012 (revision 11978)

  Simulation :

    Added Three BackLeds in the proto
    Added minPosition & maxPosition for each servos in the proto
    Revised maxForce for each servos in the proto
    Added the inertiaMatrix to all physics nodes in the proto
    Revised some centerOfMass in the proto
    Fixed bug with the mottion manager in simulation, it is now possible to play motions that are stored in more than one page

  Cross-Compilation:

    Revised accelerometer and gyro reading
    Fixed namespace issue in the module camera
    Fixed inversion of color for the rgb led
    Added a speacker module
    Added setMotorForce & getPosition in the servos module
    Fixed inversion of motion file in the motion manager
    Added setVelocity, setForce, setAcceleration, setControlP & getMotorForceFeedback in servos module
    Fixed wrong initialization of the linuxMotionTimer
    Changed enabling and disabling of the joint in the gait and motion manager
    Modified getWidth() & getHeight() in the module camera in order to change dynamically the value
    Added a minimalist self collision avoidance in setPosition of the servos module
    Modified timming management in robot step
    Changed the reading of the sensors value, everything is read in one packet (by using ReadTable function of the CM730) in the robot::step, gain of time.
