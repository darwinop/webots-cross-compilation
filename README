----- Project goals -----

- Create a simulation of the DARwIn-OP robot on the Webots simulator as realisitc as possible.
- Allow to run a controller written using exclusively the Webots API (and not the Robotis API) in simulation and in reality



----- Project structure -----

The root of the project should match with the root of Webots.
At each new Webots release, this project can be merged in the root directory of Webots.



----- Installation (beta) -----

A. Get the git repository

- 1. Let say its git repository path is called $GIT_REPOSITORY


B. Install Webots

- 1. Follow the instructions of the user manual of Webots to install Webots

- 2. Let say its installation path is called $WEBOTS_HOME


C. Install default software on the DARwIn-OP

- 1. Let say the root path of the DARwIn-OP is called $DARWINOP


D. Run the simulation

- 1. Merge the "resources" directory git repository with the "resources" directory of Webots
     $ cp -R $GIT_REPOSITORY/resources $WEBOTS_HOME

- 2. Compile the manager library by typing:
     $ cd $WEBOTS_HOME/resources/projects/robots/darwin-op/lib
     $ make
     
     => $WEBOTS_HOME/resources/projects/robots/darwin-op/lib/managers.a is generated

- 3. Compile a Sample controller
     Open Webots and compile the controller:
     $ webots $GIT_REPOSITORY/projects/robots/darwin-op/worlds/darwin-op.wbt
     From the Webots GUI, open $GIT_REPOSITORY/projects/robots/darwin-op/controllers/sample/Sample.cpp and
     hit the "Build / Build" menu item.
     Revert and play the simulation.


E. Run the same controller on the DARwIn-OP

- 1. On the DARwIn-OP, create a /darwin/Linux/project/webots directory

- 2. Copy-paste the "include", "lib", "transfer", and "src" directories of the $GIT_REPOSITORY/resources/projects/robots/darwin-op
     directory directly in the /darwin/Linux/project/webots directory

- 3. Do the same with the $GIT_REPOSITORY/projects/robots/darwin-op/controllers directory.
     Note: From now, on the real DARwIn-OP, you should have these directories:
       /darwin/Linux/project/webots/include
       /darwin/Linux/project/webots/lib
       /darwin/Linux/project/webots/transfer
       /darwin/Linux/project/webots/src
       /darwin/Linux/project/webots/controllers

- 4. Compile the wrapper library
     $ cd /darwin/Linux/project/webots/transfer/lib
     $ make

- 5. Compile the managers library
     $ cd /darwin/Linux/project/webots/lib
     $ make -f Makefile.darwin-op

- 6. Compile the controller
     $ cd /darwin/Linux/project/webots/controllers/sample
     $ make -f Makefile.darwin-op

----- Known issues ----- 

- 1. In simulation, in the DARwInOPGaitManager, the lateral balance do not work as expected.
     It is recommended to set balance_hip_roll_gain and balance_ankle_roll_gain to 0.0,
     this must be done in the file 'config.ini' attached to the controller.
- 2. In simulation the P gain of the servo affects the speed but on the real robot it affects
     the torque. This can cause differences between simulation and reality in some specific cases.
     Especially when P is small.
